## Project Summary

This repository contains the full notebook pipeline developed for the Bachelor End Project (BEP) titled "Matching Food Products to Recipes Using Data Science." The project focuses on designing a data science pipeline that matches recipe ingredients to supermarket products using natural language processing and semantic methods. The goal is to reduce retail and consumer food waste by generating recipe-based product bundles (meal boxes) from unsold or wasted inventory.

Due to NDA restrictions, no private data is included. The repository only contains executable and reproducible Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as a 32-step modular notebook pipeline. Each notebook performs a well-scoped task within the overall system:

- Notebooks 01–06: Data preview, cleaning, semantic preparation, and ontology mapping
- Notebooks 07–10: Store-level matching and prioritization logic
- Notebooks 14–24: Waste reduction simulation and strategy comparison
- Notebooks 27–30: Deployment and appendix preparation
- Notebooks 31–32: Method documentation and final audit

Each notebook is self-contained and uses standardized file paths. Output files are assumed to reside locally in structured folders such as cleaned_data, matching_scored, deployment_exports, and thesis_outputs.

## Usage

The notebooks are intended for academic review. Without the proprietary data, execution will be partial or fail on data-dependent cells. However, all logic, pipeline steps, and outputs are visible and documented.
